Use the `build.sh` script to build and install the binary to your `$GOPATH/bin`.

Make sure:
- the `$GOPATH` is correctly set.
- the `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`

After running `build.sh`, the binary will be created with the name `slackActive` and can be executed if the `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`
